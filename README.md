# Use of a physics engine to enable force feedback generation on deformable surfaces simulations

## Overview

Welcome to our project! We are focused on enhancing user interaction in virtual environments by integrating haptic feedback. Our goal is to enable users to experience tactile sensations when interacting with virtual elements, such as feeling skin texture, resistance to touch, or other specific tactile properties. Leveraging a physics engine, we simulate deformable surfaces to provide realistic feedback to users. Our development platform of choice for this project is Unity.

## Objective

 Haptic Feedback Force:
- Integrate a haptic feedback force to allow users to feel tactile sensations when interacting with virtual elements. This can include the simulation of skin texture, resistance to touch, or other specific tactile properties.

## Description

Our project focuses on enhancing user interaction in virtual environments by integrating haptic feedback. By utilizing a physics engine, we aim to provide users with realistic tactile sensations when interacting with deformable surfaces. Specifically, we are using Unity as our development platform to implement this functionality.

## Features
